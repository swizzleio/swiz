# Swizzle

Swiz allows you to orchestrate multiple infrastructure-as-code (IaC) environments. 

## ü§î Understanding Swizzle

Distributed architectures often encounter a common problem: deploy time dependencies can arise. For instance, a shared 
infrastructure stack is frequently employed. However, when deploying a stack that relies on the shared infrastructure 
stack simultaneously, there is a risk of deployment failure due to a race condition between the stacks.

This application enables the sequencing of these deployments.

A stack, which represents a single service or deployment, constitutes the smallest possible unit. Generally, a stack is
associated with a single git repository.

An environment comprises multiple stacks and can serve as a product in production, development, testing, or PR 
(pull request) scenarios.

## ü¶Ñ Best Practices (or How to Swizzle)

Since top 10's are all the rage ~~for clickbait~~, here's a list of the top 10 best practices for using Swizzle. There
is no scientific process that went into this, just ramblings from a maintainer.
1. Minimize dependency depth. Each stack should strive to be deployed independently and in parallel. A general pattern
   is to have a common stack that is deployed first, followed by the stacks that depend on it.
2. Use a single git repository per stack. This allows for the stack to be deployed independently of other stacks. Commit
   the `stack-cfg.yaml` alongside your IaC code in the same repo.
3. Commit the `env-def.yaml` file to a repo controlled by a DevOps, infrastructure and/or security team. While gate 
   keeping is not the goal, this promotes a culture of collaboration between development and teams that typically have
   to own non-functional requirements.
4. Don't boil the ocean. Great is the enemy of good. Start small and iterate.
5. Focus on eliminate the need to use the `deploy_all_stacks` flag. This flag is a sledgehammer and should be 
   used sparingly. It is a code smell that indicates that the stacks are not actually independent. Plus your AWS bill
   will thank you.
6. When a new stack is added to `env-def.yaml`, do an architecture and security review. It's easier to change things 
   before they get to production than when they are running in production.
7. Think about building out mock stacks for testing. This allows for testing of the deployment process without 
   incurring the cost of deploying the actual stack. Again, your AWS bill will thank you.
8. Use multiple enclaves and potentially build out a separate enclave for each development team. Each enclave should be
   its own AWS account.
9. Run a read-only dev test enclave in a different AWS account and region. Stacks should be tested in this account
   before getting promoted. This prevents pesky region hard coding bugs from creeping in. 
10. Figure out ways to limit resources by enclave to control costs. If deploying a dev test stack, then it probably
    doesn't need a prod sized database.

## üó∫Ô∏è Roadmap

The [product roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/swizzleio/projects/1) is kept here. The project follows the structure of
measuring debt, risk, features, and defects in the same roadmap.

* Debt: Technical debt that needs to be addressed.
* Risk: Risks that need to be addressed, such as proactively addressing security issues
* Features: New features that need to be added.
* Defects: Bugs that need to be fixed.

## üíª Development

### ‚ö°Ô∏è Prerequisites

#### Core skills
* [Golang](https://golang.org/doc/) is the language used.
* [AWS](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/index.html) is one of the cloud providers.
* [IaC concepts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_code) since that's core to what's being built.
* [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is used for source control.

#### Libraries used
* [AWS SDK for go](https://aws.github.io/aws-sdk-go-v2/docs/) for talking to AWS. Services used are:
  * [Cloudformation](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/cloudformation)
  * [IAM](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/iam)
  * [Organizations](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/organizations)
  * [STS](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/aws/aws-sdk-go-v2/service/sts)
* [Testify](https://pkg.go.dev/github.com/stretchr/testify) for testing.
* [Urfave CLI V2](https://cli.urfave.org/v2/getting-started/) as the CLI library.
* [YAML](https://pkg.go.dev/gopkg.in/yaml.v3) for parsing YAML files.
* [go-survey](https://github.com/go-survey/survey) for prompting the user for input.

### üõ†Ô∏è Building

The project uses Makefiles for building. Running `make` with no commands will print out the available commands. To build
the project, run `make build`. This will create a binary in the `out` directory.

### üî¨ Test Data

Sample test data is located in `test/data/cloudformation`. Create an AWS profile called `swiz-test` and deploy the 
stacks using the `swiz --appconfig file://test/data/cloudformation/app-config.yaml env deploy --name AwesomeEnv`
command.

The files are as follows:
* `app-config.yaml`: The application configuration file. This is typically located in the `~/.swiz` directory.
* `env-def.yaml`: The environment definition file. This is typically located in a git repository.
* `bootstrapstack-cfg.yaml`: The configuration file for the bootstrap stack. This is typically located in the same git
  repository as the IaC code in the `bootstrap.yaml` file.
* `bootstrap.yaml`: IaC code for the bootstrap stack. This is typically located in a git repository. The IaC code
  contains a lambda function and the ARN of the lambda function is used in the sleep stack. Swizzle passes the ARN
  to the sleepstack.
* `sleepstack-cfg.yaml`: The configuration file for the sleep stack. This is typically located in the same git
  repository as the IaC code in the `sleepstack.yaml` file. This also pulls common parameters and outputs from the
  bootstrap stack.
* `sleepstack.yaml`: IaC code for the sleep stack. This is typically located in a git repository.

### üèóÔ∏è Structure

The project is structured as follows:
* `cmd`: The main entry point for the application. This is intended to be kept lightweight
* `internal`: Code internal to the application. Some code here will potentially be refactored into the `pkg` 
  directory in the future.
  * `internal/appconfig`: Application config handling
  * `internal/apperr`: Application specific errors
  * `internal/cmd`: Code for the CLI commands
  * `internal/environment`: Main business logic for the application. This does the actual processing of stacks and 
  environments
* `pkg`: Code that is not application specific.
  * `pkg/configutil`: Utilities that help configure the application. 
  * `pkg/drivers`: Helpers for external services such as the AWS API
  * `pkg/errtype`: Generic errors
  * `pkg/fileutil`: Helpers for file handling
  * `pkg/preprocessor`: Preprocessors for the IaC code. This code does variable substitution and other preprocessing.
  * `pkg/security`: Security related code such as signing code.
* `test`: Test files. [See above](#-Test-Data) for more information.
